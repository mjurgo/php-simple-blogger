# Simple PHP blogging cms

Made just for practice.

## Current agenda:
-  

## Things to refactor:
- BaseModel - separate some code, move it into own classes (QueryBuilder) or methods.
- Router - handle put and delete routes according to rest.
- Implement something like "with" method from Laravel.

## Things to consider:
- ~~Creating Request class - but it would be useless at the moment.~~
- ~~Creating BaseController - would be useless at the moment.~~
- Creating View class.
- Add 'blocked' to user so that it's possible to ban them.

## Things to definitely do:
- ~~Add some styling with Bulma css.~~
- Add 'previousAction' for some redirects.
- ~~Add 'created_at' to posts and comments.~~
- ~~User profile and editing information.~~
- Unit tests.
- ~~Log user in after registering.~~
- Add 'last' method to BaseModel.
- ~~Add static pages functionality.~~
- Tinymce for blog posts/pages.
- Handle errors.
