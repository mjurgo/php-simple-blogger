# Simple PHP blogging cms

Made just for practice.

## Things to refactor:
- BaseModel - separate some code, move it into own classes (QueryBuilder) or methods,
- Router - handle put and delete routes according to rest,
- Authentication - probably create new class and handle it better,
- Implement something like "with" method from Laravel.
